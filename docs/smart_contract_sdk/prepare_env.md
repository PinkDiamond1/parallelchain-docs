# Prepare Environment

In this section, you need the tools and environment to develop and run smart contracts. You can utilize our testnet to deploy and make contract calls. 

## Verify that the testnet is live
---

To verify that our testnet is live and running, please make sure that the following URLs are working:

* [https://testnet2.digital-transaction.net](https://testnet2.digital-transaction.net) 
* [https://node1.digital-transaction.net](https://node1.digital-transaction.net) 
* [https://node1.digital-transaction.net/api](https://node1.digital-transaction.net/api) 
* [https://node1.digital-transaction.net/analytics](https://node1.digital-transaction.net/analytics) 
* [https://testnet.parallelchain.io/explorer](https://testnet.parallelchain.io/explorer) 

The ParallelChain Mainnet native tokens are called `TXPLL`.

## Testnet Explorer
---

You can see the status of your transactions and whether they are added to the block here
- [ParallelChain Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.parallelchain.io/explorer) 

The testnet explorer can explore transactions, addresses, analytics (performance of `testnet`), and blocks. Alternatively, you can use ParallelChain's light client (called `pchain`) to interact with the `testnet` node.

## Setup ParallelChain Light Client 
---

In this section, we will configure the `pchain` executable. We will assume that `pchain` runs on both Windows and Linux/MacOs as we have guides on setting up the Light Client for these platforms. 

Therefore, when you use `pchain`, the same command applies to Windows, Linux and MacOS command line interface.

See ["Installation"](../getting_started/installation.md) to install `pchain` on your pc.

## Generate an account and receive tokens
---

See [Create Account](../getting_started/create_account.md)

Congratulations, you have enough balance for writing and deploying a smart contract.
